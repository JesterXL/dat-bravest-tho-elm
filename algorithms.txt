GameFAQs
  For giving me a place other than my website to post my FAQ

Everyone at FF3 Message Boards on GameFAQS, especially Master Zed, Assassin17,
Mech Gouki, Mnrogar, and anyone else who figured out some of the things I put
in this FAQ. Thanks to Assassin17 for most of the changes in version 2.3



******************
 1.0 Introduction
******************

This FAQ explains how the algorithms and calculations for Final Fantasy III
work. It contains details on how damage is calculated, how random encounters
are determined, as well as how other items and things work.  Obviously, this
FAQ doesn't cover everything, but it's getting closer.

NOTE: All divisions done in all calculations are integer division. This means
the result after the division is truncated (rounded down), so (4 / 2) = 2,
(8 / 3) = 2, and ((17 / 2) / 5) = (8 / 5) = 1.


[A..B] is used to indicate a random number between A and B inclusive. For
example [2..4] is a random number: either 2, 3, or 4.


                            **********************
                             2.0 Basic Algorithms
                            **********************


************************
 2.1 Damage calculation
************************

Determining the amount of damage an attack can do is complicated, and I broke
it down into 9 steps. The 1st step has 4 parts. Depending on whether the attack
is physical or magical, and whether the attacker it a character or monster, it
uses a different part of step 1. After step 1, you have the base maximum
damage that the attack can do. The following 8 steps will further modify the
damage, and are used for all attacks, magical or physical, made by monsters or
characters. At the end of all steps you will have the amount of damage the
attack can do.


Step 1. Maximum damage calculation

  For magical attacks made by characters:

    Damage = Spell Power * 4 + (Level * Magic Power * Spell Power / 32)

  
  For magical attacks made by monsters:

    Damage = Spell Power * 4 + (Level * (Magic Power * 3/2) * Spell Power / 32)


  For physical attacks made by characters :

    Step 1a. Vigor2 = Vigor * 2
             If Vigor >= 128 then Vigor2 = 255 instead

    Step 1b. Attack = Battle Power + Vigor2

    Step 1c. If equipped with Gauntlet, Attack = Attack + Battle Power * 3 / 4

    Step 1d. Damage = Battle Power + ((Level * Level * Attack) / 256) * 3 / 2

    Step 1e. If character is equipped with an Offering:

    Damage = Damage / 2

    Step 1f. If the attack is a standard fight attack and the character is
    equipped with a Genji Glove, but only one or zero weapons:

    Damage = ceil(Damage * 3 / 4)


  For physical attacks made by monsters :
        
    Step 1a. Damage = Level * Level * (Battle Power * 4 + Vigor) / 256

    Note that vigor for each monster is randomly determined at the beginning of
    the battle as [56..63]


Step 2. Atlas Armlet / Earring

  Step 2a. If physical attack and attacker is equipped with Atlas Armlet or
  Hero Ring:

  Damage = Damage * 5/4

  Step 2b. If magical attack and attacker is equipped with 1 Earring or
  Hero Ring:

  Damage = Damage * 5/4 

  Step 2c. If magical attack and attacker is equipped with 2 Earrings / Hero
  Rings:

  Damage = Damage + (Damage / 4) + (Damage / 4)


Step 3. Multiple targets

  If magical attack and the attack is targeting more than one target:

  Damage = Damage / 2

  Note: Some spells skip this step


Step 4. Attacker's row

  If Fight command and the attacker is in the back row:

  Damage = Damage / 2


Step 5. Damage Multipliers #1

  The damage multiplier starts out = 0.

  The following add to the damage multiplier:

  Morph (attacker) - If Attacker has morph status add 2 to damage multiplier

  Berserk - If physical attack and attacker has berserk status add 1 to damage
  multiplier
  
  Critical hit -
    Standard attacks have a 1 in 32 chance of being a critical hit. If attack
    is a critical hit add 2 to damage multiplier

  Step 5a. Damage = Damage + ((Damage / 2) * damage multiplier)


Step 6. Damage modification

  Step 6a. Random Variance

    Damage = (Damage * [224..255] / 256) + 1

  Step 6b. Defense modification

    Damage = (Damage * (255 - Defense) / 256) + 1

    Magical attacks use Magic defense

  Step 6c. Safe / Shell

    If magical attack and target has shell status, or physical attack and
    target has safe status:

    Damage = (Damage * 170 / 256) + 1

  Step 6d. Target Defending

    If physical attack and target is Defending:

    Damage = Damage / 2

  Step 6e. Target's row

    If physical attack and target is in back row:

    Damage = Damage / 2

  Step 6f. Morph (target)

    If magical attack and target has morph status:

    Damage = Damage / 2
    
  Step 6g. Self Damage

    Healing attacks skip this step

    If the attacker and target are both characters:

    Damage = Damage / 2


Step 7. Damage multipliers #2

  The damage multiplier starts out = 0.

  The following add to the damage multiplier:

  Hitting target in back - If physical attack and attack hits the back of the
    target, then 1 is added to the damage multiplier

  Step 7a. Damage = Damage + ((Damage / 2) * damage multiplier)


Step 8. Petrify damage

  If the target has petrify status, then damage is set to 0.


Step 9. Elemental resistance

  For each step, if the condition is met, no further steps are checked. So for
  example, if the target absorbs the element, then steps 9c to 9e are not
  checked.

  Step 9a. If the element has been nullified (by Force Field), then: Damage = 0.

  Step 9b. If target absorbs the element of the attack, then damage is
           unchanged, but it heals HP instead of dealing damage

  Step 9c. If target is immune to the element of the attack: Damage = 0

  Step 9d. If target is resistant to the element of the attack:
           Damage = Damage / 2

  Step 9e. If target is weak to the element of the attack: Damage = Damage * 2


***********************
 2.2 Hit Determination
***********************

  If at any step the attack always hits or always misses, then any further
  steps are skipped.

  Step 1. Clear

    If physical attack and the target has clear status, the attack always misses
    If magical attack and the target has clear status, the attack always hits.

  Step 2. Death Protection

    If the target is protected from Wound status, and the attack misses death
    protected targets, then the attack always misses.

  Step 3. Unblockable attacks

    If the spell is unblockable, then it always hits.

  Step 4. Check to hit for normal attacks

    Attacks which can be blocked by Stamina skip this step, and instead use
    step 5.

    Step 4a. If target has Sleep, Petrify, Freeze, or Stop status, then the
             attack always hits.

    Step 4b. If attack is physical and hits the back of the target, then it
             always hits.

    Step 4c. If perfect (255) hit rate, then the attack always hits.

    Step 4d. If physical attack, and target has Image status, then the attack
             always misses, and there is a 1 in 4 chance of removing the
             Image status.

    Step 4e. Chance to hit

      1. BlockValue = (255 - MBlock * 2) + 1
 
      2. If BlockValue > 255 then BlockValue = 255
         If BlockValue < 1 then BlockValue = 1

      3. If ((Hit Rate * BlockValue) / 256) > [0..99] then you hit; otherwise,
         you miss.

  Step 5. Check to hit for attacks that can be blocked by Stamina

    Most attacks use step 4 instead of this step. Only Break, Doom, Demi,
    Quartr, X-Zone, W Wind, Shoat, Odin, Raiden, Antlion, Snare, X-Fer, and
    Grav Bomb use this step.

    Step 5a. Chance to hit

      1. BlockValue = (255 - MBlock * 2) + 1
 
      2. If BlockValue > 255 then BlockValue = 255
         If BlockValue < 1 then BlockValue = 1

      3. If ((Hit Rate * BlockValue) / 256) > [0..99] then you hit, otherwise
      you miss.

    Step 5b. Check if Stamina blocks

      If target's stamina >= [0..127] then the attack misses (even if it hit in
      step 5a); otherwise, the attack hits as long as it hit in step 5a.


***********************
 2.3 Random Encounters
***********************

The game keeps a counter that increases each time you take a step. Walking on
the overworld map adds 192 to the counter for each step taken; walking in
caves, towns, etc. where monsters can be encountered adds 112 to the counter
for each step. Each step, a random number is picked from 0 to 255; if this
number is less than (counter / 256 ) then a fight occurs. When a random
encounter occurs, the counter is reset to 0.  If the lead party member has a
Charm Bangle equipped, then the number added is cut in half. If Mog has the
Moogle Charm equipped, then the counter is not increased, and there is no
chance of random encounters.


**********************
 2.4 Averaging levels
**********************

When a character first joins your party (in the World of Balance, or the World
of Ruin), their level is calculated based on the average level of your current
party members.  The level for characters is also recalculated at a few other
points in the game as well.  When you first start the game with Terra, her
level is always 3.

The new character's level =
Average of all current members' levels (rounded down)

If a character is joining in the WoR, then the new level will never be lower
than their old level.

If a character is joining for the first time, then a value is added to the
average party level to determine their new level, as follows for each
character:

Terra  : +0
Locke  : +2
Cyan   : +2
Shadow : +0
Edgar  : +2
Sabin  : +2
Celes  : +0
Strago : +2
Relm   : +0
Setzer : +0
Mog    : +5
Gau    : +2
Gogo   : +2
Umaro  : +0
Banon  : -3
Leo    : +5


*************************
 2.5 Desperation Attacks
*************************

If you attack while the character's current HP < their max HP / 8, then there
is a 1 in 16 chance of doing a desperation attack instead of a normal attack.

Gau and Umaro do not have desperation attacks.

If the character has any of the following statuses, then they will never do
a desperation attack: Muddle, Image, Clear, Zombie

Characters will never use their desperation attack more than once each combat.

While the Battle Time Counter (See section 2.8 Battle Timing) is less than
768, characters won't use their desperation attacks. (i.e. Characters will
never use Desperation Attacks during the first 25.6 seconds of combat)

All Desperation attacks are unblockable (see step 3 in hit determination)

All Desperation attacks are magical attacks, that ignore defense (skip steps
5, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, and 7 in damage calculation.)

Sabre Soul and Star Prism are instant death attacks, rather than damage-dealing
attacks like the others. Shadow Fang will also inflict seizure status.

Here is every character's desperation attack:

Char     Attack              Power
Locke    Mirager             139
Terra    Riot Blade          142
Celes    Spin Edge           143
Edgar    Royal Shock         143
Sabin    Tiger Break         140
Cyan     Back Blade          140
Mog      Moogle Rush         150
Strago   Sabre Soul            0
Relm     Star Prism            0
Shadow   Shadow Fang         140
Setzer   Red Card            147
Gogo     X-Meteo             146


*********************
 2.6 Character Stats
*********************

Vigor:

Higher vigor increases damage done by physical attacks (see section 2.1
Damage calculation).  Raising Vigor over 128 with relics and equipment does
no more damage than having a Vigor of 128.

Monsters do not have individual Vigor stats; instead, their vigor is randomly
determined at the beginning of combat as : [56..63]


Speed:

The higher speed a character has, the faster their ATB gauge increases in
combat. (see section 2.8 Battle Timing)


Stamina:

Stamina increases you chance of blocking most instant death attacks. (see
section 2.2 Hit Determination, step 5)

Stamina increases the amount of HP gained by Tintinabar (see section 5.17),
and Regen (see section 2.7 Status effects), as well as the damage done by poison
and seizure (see section 2.7 Status Effects).

As with Vigor, monsters do not have individual Stamina stats; a monster's
Stamina is figured as follows:

Stamina = (Max HP / 512) + 16. If this number is greater than 40, then the
monster's stamina is 40 instead.


Mag. Pwr:

Mag. Pwr increases damage done by magical attacks (see section 2.1 Damage
Calculation). Unlike Vigor, increasing Mag. Pwr over 128 is more effective.


Evade%:

Evade% is supposed to increase the chance of dodging physical attacks, but due
to a bug in the game, Evade% has no effect, so don't bother trying to
increase it.


MBlock%:

MBlock% increases the chance of dodging attacks (due to a bug in the game, this
affects both magical and physical attacks)


********************
 2.7 Status Effects
********************

Dark:

Dark is supposed to make it harder to hit with physical attacks, but due to
the same bug that makes Evade useless, Dark does not decrease your chance to
hit with physical attacks. The only effect Dark has is that Strago can't
learn new lores while blinded.


Zombie:

While in Zombie status, a character is uncontrollable and automatically
attacks. Characters in Zombie status do not die when reduced to 0 HP.

When a zombie character hits, they have a 1 in 16 chance of inflicting
dark status on the target, and a 1 in 16 chance of inflicting poison status
on the target.


Poison:

While a character is poisoned, they will periodically take poison damage.
Damage from poison is taken approximtely once every 17 seconds, more often if
you're hasted, less often if you're slowed (see section 2.8 Battle Timing for
exact details). The amount of damage done by poison is calculated as follows:

Max Damage = (Max HP * stamina / 1024) + 2 (if this value is greater than
255 it is set to 255)
Damage = Max Damage * ([224..255]) / 256
If a character is poisoned (instead of a monster), Damage = Damage / 2

This damage is the amount of damage taken from Poison the first time in
combat. The second time, the damage is double; the third time it is tripled,
etc.  This damage levels off after the eighth round; in other words, the damage
taken from Poison in a round (for characters or monsters) can't exceed 8x what
it was the first round (random variance aside).

Outside of combat, the amount of damage done per step is : (Max HP / 32). This
will never reduce HP below 1.



M-Tek:

While in this status, the character is wearing Magitek Armor, they can't use
their normal commands, and instead can only use M-Tek. Terra has extra
M-Tek commands that other characters don't. If Umaro has this status, he will
use a random M-Tek attack rather than his standard attacks.

This status is only used three times in the game: in the beginning, in the
camp in the desert, and in a part of Cyan's Dream.


Clear:

This status is inflicted by casting Vanish. While in this status, physical
attacks will always miss the target, and magical attacks will always hit.

Any magical attack will remove the clear status.


Imp:

While in Imp status a character can only use fight, item, and magic commands.
The only magic that can be cast is Imp.

While an Imp, the Battle Power of the character's weapon is not added to their
base battle power when determining damage (1 is added instead), unless equipped
with an Imp Halberd.

For monsters, their battle power is instead considered to be 1 while an Imp.

Some monsters however, retain their full battle power while imped, and do
automatic critical hits as well.


Petrify:

While in Petrify status, the character cannot act. Their HP is reduced to 0, but
they don't die.

All damage done to a petrified character is reduced to 0 (see step
8 in damage calculation). Note that the Atma weapon adds 1 to the damage after
this, and thus can do 1 damage to a petrified character.

Attacks always hit a character with Petrify status (see step 4a in hit
determination).

If a monster is ever inflicted with Petrify status, then they are automatically
killed.


Wound:

This means the character is dead, and cannot act until revived.


Condemned:

In Condemned status, the character has a countdown over their head. When this
countdown reaches 0, the character dies. The value that the countdown starts
at is determined as follows:

Timer = 79 - a random number from level to ((2 * level) - 1)
If this value is less than 20 then the countdown is set to 20 instead
Level refers to the level of the monster/character that cast the spell that
caused Condemned status.

The countdown timer is decreased by 1 approximately once every 2 seconds, more
often if you're hasted, and less often if you're slowed (see section 2.8 Battle
Timing for exact details).


Near Fatal:

This status means the character is below 1/8 of their max HP. Characters
can use desperation attacks while in Near Fatal status (see section 2.5
Desperation Attacks).


Image:

While in image status, all physical attacks will miss the character. Every time
the character is missed by a physical attack, there is a 1 in 4 chance of the
image status being removed.


Mute:

While in mute status, a character can't cast spells or lores.  If a spell or
lore is confirmed before the character gets Muted, or if they're casting it
via Rage or Sketch, they'll still be able to use it if it *normally* costs
0 MP (Rage/Sketch making it free won't matter).


Berserk:

While in berserk status, a character is uncontrollable, and will automatically
attack a random enemy. In berserk status characters do more damage (see step 5
in damage calculation). To determine which command the character uses, a list
is created. Each of these comands: Fight, Capture, Jump, Rage, and Magitek,
that the character can use is added to the list. An extra Fight command is
added as well (even if the character can't normally use the Fight command). One
of the commands from the list is randomly chosen to be used. Monsters always do
a standard attack while berserked. If a character selects a command before being
berserked, but before they act, then the command selected is still executed.


Muddle:

Muddled characters are uncontrollable and will take random actions. If the
action would normally target the enemy, it targets you characters instead.
If the action would normally target your characters, it targets the enemies
instead. The following commands will never be used when muddled: Item, Revert,
Throw, Control, Slot, Leap, Def., Summon, and Possess.
Being hit by a physical attack will remove Muddle status. If a character selects
a command before being muddled, but before they act, then the command selected
is still executed, although the target(s) change.


Seizure:

Seizure status causes periodic damage to the character, just like poison. The
amount of damage done is the same as poison, except the damage does not
increase over time.

Damage from seizure is taken approximtely once every 8.5 seconds, more often if
you're hasted, less often if you're slowed (see section 2.8 Battle Timing for
exact details). 

Since seizure status is not poison, spells / relics that prevent or cure
poison will have no effect against seizure.


Sleep:

While asleep, characters cannot select commands.  While asleep, the character's
ATB gauge does not increase. (see section 2.8 Battle Timing)

All attacks will automatically hit a character with sleep status, and any
physical attack will remove sleep status. A tapir will appear and wake up the
monster/character after approximately 38 seconds, faster if you're hasted,
slower if you're slowed (see section 2.8 Battle Timing for exact details)


Dance:

This is the status you receive when you successfully dance. While in dance
status, a character is uncontrollable and instead randomly uses dance moves.
See the section on the Dance command for more info.


Regen:

While in regen status, a character will be periodically healed. The amount
of HP healed is calculated as follows:

Max HP Gained = (Max HP * stamina / 1024) + 2 (if this value is greater than
255 it is set to 255)
HP Gained = Max HP Gained * ([224..255]) / 256

HP is gained from Regen approximtely once every 8.5 seconds, more often if
you're hasted, less often if you're slowed (see section 2.8 Battle Timing for
exact details). 


Slow:

Slow status causes the character's ATB gauge increase at a slower than normal
rate (See section 2.8 Battle Timing).


Haste:

Haste status causes the character's ATB gauge increase at a faster than normal
rate (See section 2.8 Battle Timing).


Stop:

While stopped, a character's ATB gauge does not increase. Wears off after
approximately 38 seconds, less time if you're hasted, and more time if you're
slowed (See section 2.8 Battle timing for exact details)


Shell:

Shell status causes a character to take 170/256 normal damage from magical
attacks (see step 6c in Damage Calculation). Defense ignoring attacks ignore
shell status.


Safe:

Safe status causes a character to take 170/256 normal damage from physical
attacks (see step 6c in Damage Calculation). Defense ignoring spells ignore
safe status.


Reflect:

Reflect status causes spells to be reflected back at the caster's party.
Reflected spells deal half normal damage. Not all spells are reflectable. Wears
off after approximately 55 seconds, less time if you're hasted, and more time
if you're slowed (See section 2.8 Battle timing for exact details)


*******************
 2.8 Battle Timing
*******************

In battle, the game keeps track of a battle time counter. This counter is
incremented by one approximately 30 times a second. If the "Bat. Mode" is
set to "Wait", then the counter will not be incremented while you're
selecting spells, items, etc. from the menu. Every time this counter is
incremented, each character's and monster's ATB gauge is increased by the
following amount:

For characters:

Normal speed:

(96 * (Speed + 20)) / 16

If Hasted:

(126 * (Speed + 20)) / 16

If Slowed:

(48 * (Speed + 20)) / 16

For monsters:

Normal speed:

((96 * (Speed + 20)) * (255 - ((Battle Speed - 1) * 24))) / 16

If Hasted:

((126 * (Speed + 20)) * (255 - ((Battle Speed - 1) * 24))) / 16

If Slowed:

((48 * (Speed + 20)) * (255 - ((Battle Speed - 1) * 24))) / 16

Battle Speed is controlled by the "Bat.Speed" option in the game's
Config menu.

Because Speed + 20 must fit in a single byte, any speed over 235 would
result in a very slow-moving ATB gauge.

Once the ATB gauge has reached 65536, then characters are able to select
a command.  The battle time counter and ATB gauges will increase during
attack animations, as well as while you select a command, but not while
selecting spells, items, etc. from a menu if "Bat. Mode" is set to "Wait".


Each character and monster also has an individual Time counter. Once every 16
times that the Battle timer is increased these counters are increased by the
following amount:

If character/monster is at normal speed: 64
If character/monster is hasted: 84
If character/monster is slowed: 32


If any character's/monster's time counter is over 255, then that counter is
reduced by 256 and the following occur:


If the character/monster has Stop status, then the "stop timer" is reduced by
1. If the "stop timer" reaches 0, then Stop status is removed. When inflicted
with Stop status, the "stop timer" is set 18.

If the character/monster does not have Stop status then the following also
occur:


If the party is trying to run, then the character will get a chance to run (see
section 2.13 Running From Combat)

If the character/monster has Condemned status, the countdown is decreased by 1.
(See the section for Condemned status)

If they have Reflect status, then the "reflect timer" is reduced by 1. If the
"reflect timer" reaches 0, then Reflect status is removed. When inflicted with
Reflect status, the "reflect timer" is set 26.

If they have Freeze status, then the "freeze timer" is reduced by 1. If the
"freeze timer" reaches 0, then Freeze status is removed. When inflicted with
Freeze status, the "freeze timer" is set 34.

If they have Sleep status, then the "sleep timer" is reduced by 1. If the
"sleep timer" reaches 0, then Sleep status is removed. When inflicted with
Sleep status, the "sleep timer" is set 18.

1 in 8 times, the character/monster will receive Poison damage if they are
poisoned.

2 in 8 times, the character/monster will receive Seizure damage if they have
Seizure status.

2 in 8 times, the character/monster will gain HP from Regen if they have Regen
status.


*******************
 2.9 Dropped Items
*******************

At the end of combat, the game checks each monster to see which item it will
drop.  Each monster has a 1 in 8 chance of dropping their rare item; otherwise,
they drop their common item.  If the monster doesn't have an item in that slot
then it doesn't drop anything.

Note that most monsters only have a rare item, and some monsters don't have
either, which means they'll never drop an item.


************************
 2.10 Finding Doom Gaze
************************

In the World of Ruin, if you haven't defeated Doom Gaze, Doom Gaze moves to a
random location on the World Map every time you get on or off the airship.
While you're flying around, Doom Gaze stays in the same location. Although its
location is random, Doom Gaze always stays still while you're flying, so in
order to ensure that you find Doom Gaze, you need to cover the entire map.


*****************
 2.11 Saving Cid
*****************

When you're trying to save (or kill) Cid on the deserted island, the game
keeps track of a counter for Cid's health.  This counter starts at 120 and
decreases by 1 every second (when you're in the menu screen or a battle,
the counter doesn't decrease).  Feeding Cid fish lowers or raises the counter,
depending on the type of fish (as follows):

Fish (Slow speed)            -16
A Rotten Fish (Medium speed) -4
Just a Fish (Medium speed)   +16
A Yummy Fish (Fast speed)    +32

If you feed him multiple fish at a time, the effects of all of the fish count.
The type(s) of fish that are in the water is reset every time you talk to Cid.

What Cid says when you talk to him depends on this "health" counter as follows:

231 - 255 My dear, I ... feel I'm not going to be around much longer...

201 - 230 CELES, thanks for all you've done for me!

161 - 200 HackAck!! I feel a little better!

121 - 160 Cough...wheeze...I can't bear this any longer...

91  - 120 I...I'm not long for this cruel new world ...

61  - 90  My worst nightmare is to think of you alone here on this wretched
          island ... hack ... wheeze!!

31  - 60  Cough...hack...ACK!! While I can still talk, I...wheeze...pant...want
          to thank you...cough!

0   - 30  Good-bye...

If you enter his room when the counter is below 30, then Cid is dead when you
talk to him (If the counter is over 30 when you enter, but lowers below 30 while
you're in the room, Cid won't die until you leave and come back in).

If you feed Cid fish which increase the counter to 256 or more, then Cid is
saved.


**********************
 2.12 Umaro's attacks
**********************

When Umaro attacks, he has 4 different attacks he can use: a standard attack,
a charge attack where he flies at the enemy, a rage attack where he throws a
character at the enemy (only if equipped with Rage Ring), and a Storm attack
(only if equipped with Blizzard Orb).

The chance he'll use each attack is:

If no Rage Ring or Blizzard Orb equipped:

159/255 chance : Normal attack
96/255 chance  : Charge attack

If equipped with a Rage Ring:

95/255 chance  : Normal attack
64/255 chance  : Charge attack
96/255 chance  : Rage attack

If equipped with a Blizzard Orb:

95/255 chance  : Normal attack
64/255 chance  : Charge attack
96/255 chance  : Storm attack

If equipped with a Rage Ring and Blizzard Orb:

63/255 chance  : Normal attack
64/255 chance  : Charge attack
64/255 chance  : Storm attack
64/255 chance  : Rage attack

Normal Attack:

This is just a normal fight attack, using the standard chance to hit, and
damage calculations.

Charge Attack:

This attack uses the same chance to hit calculations as a normal attack. For
determining damage, it uses the same calculations as a normal attack, except
that it ignores defense (skips steps 5, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, and 7 in damage
calculation)

Storm Attack:

This is the "Storm" monster attack (see section 11.0). It's a Magical attack
with 100 Spell power that hits all enemies. It's also unblockable (see step 3
in hit determination)

Rage Attack:

This is the attack where Umaro throws a character. In order to use this attack
there must be at least one character besides Umaro that is alive and present.
If there isn't then Umaro will do a charge attack instead.

Umaro determines at random which character to throw. However, if any character
has Sleep or Muddle status, then Umaro will always choose to throw that
character. If more than one character has Sleep or Muddle status, then the
character with Muddle or Sleep who is closest to the top of the screen is
thrown. When a character is thrown, Sleep and Muddle status are automatically
removed from them.

The chance to hit is calculated normally. For determining damage, the battle
power of the attack is equal to Umaro's battle power plus the thrown character's
battle power (or 255 if that number is over 255). The attack is also defense
ignoring (skips step 5, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, and 7 of damage calculation).



**************************
 2.13 Running from combat
**************************

The chance to run from a combat is dependent on that character, which monster(s)
are present, and how long you've been trying to run.

The game keeps track of a "run difficulty" variable. In side attacks this
value is 0; otherwise, the value is equal to 2 times the number of monsters
present (some monsters are harder to run from and add 6 to this value instead
of 2). There is also a "run success" variable for each character. This value
starts at 0 for each character.

Approximately once every 2 seconds, more often for hasted characters, less
often for slowed characters (see section 2.8 Batle Timing for exact details),
the game checks to see if the characters are trying to run (it won't check
during attack animations). If they are trying to run, then each character's
"run success" value is increased. The amount added is dependent on the
character, and is a random number from 1 to a maximum value depending on the
character as follows:

Terra:     4
Locke:     5
Cyan:      3
Shadow:    5
Edgar:     4
Sabin:     4
Celes:     4
Strago:    3
Relm:      5
Setzer:    4
Mog:       5
Gau:       5
Gogo:      4
Umaro:     3
Banon:     2
Leo:       3
Vicks:     4
Wedge:     4

If the character's "run success" value is greater than or equal to the "run
difficulty" value, and the character's ATB gauge is full, then they
successfully run away, otherwise they keep trying, and 2 seconds later their
"run success" value is increased again.

If certain monsters are present (bosses, ninjas, phases, etc.) then characters
can't run no matter what. They also can't run if caught in a pincer attack and
monsters are still alive on both sides.


*********************
 2.14 Shadow Leaving
*********************

Any time after the Imperial Camp, and before the Floating Continent, and not
on the Phantom Train, if Shadow is in your party he has a chance to leave at
the end of combat. He has a 1 in 16 chance of leaving at the end of every
combat. If Shadow is the only character alive, then he won't run. If the
combat is a pincer, side, or back attack he won't run. Shadow also won't run
if he has Wound, Petrify, or Zombie status.


*************************************************
 2.15 Pincer, Side, Back, and Preemptive attacks
*************************************************

Which type of battle you encounter depends on which types are allowed. If any
character is equipped with a Back Guard, then Pincer and Back attacks are
disabled. Depending on which monster formation you encounter certain types
may be disabled as well. (Get FF3usME at http://www.angelire.com/pq/jumparound
to see which battle types each formation allows). Most formations allow all
types, some disabled pincer attacks, a few disable other types. Most boss
battles disable all but Normal attacks.

If only one type of battle is allowed, then that is the type of battle you
encounter. Otherwise the chance for each depends on which are allowed as
follows:

If all types allowed:
Normal:   208/255 chance
Back:     8/255 chance
Pincer:   8/255 chance
Side:     31/255 chance

If normal, back, and pincer allowed:
Normal:   13/14 chance
Back:     1/28 chance
Pincer:   1/28 chance

If normal, back, and side allowed:
Normal:   208/247 chance
Back:     8/247 chance
Side:     31/247 chance

If normal, and back allowed:
Normal:   26/27 chance
Back:     1/27 chance

If normal, pincer, and side allowed:
Normal:   208/247 chance
Pincer:   8/247 chance
Side:     31/247 chance

If normal, and pincer allowed:
Normal:   26/27 chance
Pincer:   1/27 chance

If normal and side allowed:
Normal:   208/239 chance
Side:     31/239 chance

If back, pincer, and side allowed:
Back:     8/47 chance
Pincer:   8/47 chance
Side:     31/47 chance

If back, and pincer allowed:
Back:     1/2 chance
Pincer:   1/2 chance

If back, and side allowed:
Back:     8/39 chance
Side:     31/39 chance

If pincer, and side allowed:
Pincer:   8/39 chance
Side:     31/39 chance

Pincer and back attacks will never be a preemptive attacks. For a normal
attack there is a 1 in 8 chance of a preemptive attack. Side attacks have a
7 in 32 chance of being a preemptive attack. If any character is equipped with
a Gale Hairpin, then the chances are doubled. Certain monster formations
(mostly bosses) disable preemptive attacks.


************
 2.16 Veldt
************

When fighting on the veldt, the monsters you run into are not completely
random. Instead you run into 1 battle from a group, and then the next time,
you run into a battle from the next group (the groups are listed below).

When you first start a new game, the first group you'll run into a battle
from is group 1. To determine which battle in the group you run into, the game
picks a random number from 0 to 7, and that determines which battle you'll
encounter.

However, you can only run into battles that you've run into before (you don't
need to have won the battle; if you escape, you can encounter it on the Veldt
as well). If the game determines that you should run into a battle that you
haven't encountered, then you encounter the next battle in the group instead.
It keeps doing this until it finds a battle that you've encountered. If you're
on battle 7 of a group and haven't encountered that battle, it starts over at
battle 0 from the group and keeps checking.

Some battles can't ever be encountered on the Veldt (these are mostly boss
battles). These are marked as "Empty" in the list. If a battle is empty, it's
treated exactly the same as if you have never encountered it.

After you fight a battle, the next time you fight on the veldt you'll fight a
battle from the next group, or if you're on group 64, then the next fight will
be from group 1.  If a group is entirely empty and/or you haven't encountered
any battles from the group, it skips that group and moves on to the next group.
It keeps doing this until it runs into a group which has 1 or more battles
that you have encountered.

When you reload a game, it adds 13 to the group number that you'll fight next.

A special note about the 2 SrBehemoth battles (in groups 54 and 57): After you
beat the living SrBehemoth in the Veldt Cave (Don't Vanish + X-Zone him!), the
game turns on a flag that causes the undead SrBehemoth formation to be loaded
whenever a subsequent battle (i.e. a Veldt one) tries to load the living
SrBehemoth formation.  When you beat the undead one in the Veldt Cave, the
game marks the LIVING formation as encounterable for the Veldt (this works
because one variable still holds the first formation number, but all the
enemies in the current formation have a value <= 255).

So you can now encounter the SrBehemoth (undead) battle in group 57 on the
Veldt, in place of SrBehemoth (living).  Once you've fought that, you'll also
be able to encounter the SrBehemoth (undead) battle in group 54.

                                *************
                                 3.0 Weapons
                                *************
**************************
 3.1 Randomly casts spell
**************************

Weapons with this effect: Flame Sabre (Fire), Blizzard (Ice),
ThunderBlade (Bolt), Break Blade (Break), Soul Sabre (Doom),
Illumina (Pearl), Ragnarok (Flare), Pearl Lance (Pearl),
Stunner (Stop), Fire Rod (Fire 2), Ice Rod (Ice 2), Thunder Rod (Bolt 2),
Poison Rod (Poison), Pearl Rod (Pearl), Gravity Rod (Quartr),
Doom Darts (Doom), Poison Claw (Poison), Fire Knuckle (Fire).

For weapons that randomly cast a spell when they hit the enemy, the
chance that the spell will be cast is 1 in 4. 

This spell can't be absorbed by Runic or reflected by the Reflect status, and
costs 0 MP to cast.

If the spell that is cast can be blocked by Stamina (see step 5 in hit
determination), then the chance to hit for the spell is determined as
normal. Otherwise that spell always hits (see step 3 in hit determination).

The damage done by the spell is determined as normal, with a few exceptions:

1. The spell does not ignore your row, so if you're in the back row it will
do half damage. If the weapon that cast the spell ignores row, then the spell
cast will still do full damage if you're in the back row.

2. The damage multiplier added by Jump (see section 6.9) affects the spell as
well, so if you jump and it casts a spell, then the spell does extra damage.

3. If the weapon does automatic criticals, then the spell automatically does
a critical as well (even though spells normally can't do criticals). However,
if the weapon does a critical because of the standard 1 in 32 chance, then the
spell does not do a critical.


***************************
 3.2 Casts spell when used
***************************

Weapons with this effect: Fire Rod (Fire 2), Ice Rod (Ice 2),
Thunder Rod (Bolt 2), Poison Rod (Poison), Pearl Rod (Pearl),
Gravity Rod (Quartr).

When an item casts a spell when used, the item is destroyed when used. The
spell cast uses the same chance to hit, and damage calculation as if cast by
the character, with the exception that it skips steps 6 and 7 of damage
calculation.


*******************************************
 3.3 Deals normal damage from the back row
*******************************************

Weapons with this effect: Illumina, Flail, Full Moon, Morning Star, Boomerang,
Rising Sun, Hawk Eye, Sniper, Wing Edge, Cards, Darts, Doom Dart, Trump, Dice,
Fixed Dice.

Weapons with this effect still deal full damage if the character equipped with
the weapon is in the back row (i.e. skips step 4 of damage calculation).
However, it still gets reduced damage if the target is in the back row.

*********************************
 3.4 Uses MP to do critical hits
*********************************

Weapons with this effect: Rune Edge, Illumina, Ragnarok, Punisher

These weapons Uses MP to do automatic critical hits. The amount of MP
used = [12..19]. If the attacker does not have that many MP, then no MP are
used, but the attack is not a critical hit either (although it still has the
standard 1 in 32 chance of doing a critical)

*********************
 3.5 Ignores Defense
*********************

Weapons with this effect: Atma Weapon, ValiantKnife

These weapons ignore the defense of the target, as well as many other steps in
damage calculation. The steps skipped are:  5 - Damage Multiplier #1,
6b - Defense Modifcation, 6c - Safe, 6d - Target Defending, 6e - Target's Row,
6f - Morph (target), and 7 - Damage Multiplier #2.

**************************
 3.6 Randomly kills enemy
**************************

Weapons with this effect: Assassin, Striker, Wing Edge, Trump

If the target is undead, then it is always killed, and then revived. If the
target is not undead, there is a 25% chance that the Weapon will attempt
to kill it. Stamina can block this (see step 5b in hit determination).

*****************
 3.7 Atma Weapon
*****************

Deals damage as normal weapon with the following exception:

After step 9 in damage calculation, the damage is modified as follows:

step 10a. damage = damage * level
step 10b. damage = damage * ((current HP / 256) + 1) / ((max HP / 256) + 1)
step 10c. damage = (damage / 64) + 1

Is also defense ignoring (see section 3.5)

The length of the Atma Weapon is determined solely by the damage you do as
follows:

Damage       Length
0 - 500      Shortest
501 - 1000   Medium
1001 - 9999  Longest


**********
 3.8 Dice
**********

damage = Dice Roll 1 * Dice Roll 2 * Level * 2

Skips all normal steps for physical damage calculation.

For determining the dice rolls, each number does not have an equal chance of
coming up. 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have a 18.75% chance of coming up.  5 and 6
only have a 12.5% chance of coming up.


*************
 3.9 Drainer
*************

Heals the attacker an amount equal to the damage dealt. Cannot do more damage
than the attacker's max HP - current HP. If the target is undead, then it
heals the target, and hurts the attacker instead.


*****************
 3.10 Fixed Dice
*****************

damage = Dice Roll 1 * Dice Roll 2 * Dice Roll 3 * Level * 2

if all Dice Rolls are the same then:

damage = damage * Dice Roll

Skips all normal steps for physical damage calculation.

For determining the dice rolls, each number does not have an equal chance of
coming up. 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have a 18.75% chance of coming up.  5 and 6
only have a 12.5% chance of coming up.


***************
 3.11 Hawk Eye
***************

Has a 50% chance of having an additional effect, as follows:

If the target has float status, then the Hawk eye is thrown at the target,
and 4 is added to the damage multiplier (see step 7 of damage calculation).
If the target does not have the float status, then 1 is added to the damage
multiplier (see step 7 of damage calculation).

Does full damage from the back row (see section 3.3)


***************
 3.12 Heal Rod
***************

Heals HP instead of dealing damage.

Ignores self damage (see step 6g in damage calculation).

Has a perfect (255) hit rate (see step 4c in hit determination).


******************

power from the weapon if they have imp status; otherwise, the battle power
of the weapon is considered to be 1.

***************
 3.14 Illumina
***************

Has a perfect (255) hit rate (see step 4c in hit determination).

Deals normal damage from the back row (see section 3.3).

***************

If the target has float status, then the Sniper is thrown at the target,
and 4 is added to the damage multiplier (see step 7 of damage calculation).

multiplier (see step 7 of damage calculation).

Does full damage from the back row (skips step 4 of damage calculation).
See also Section 3.3.


*****************
 3.19 Soul Sabre
*****************

Does MP damage instead of HP damage.  Heals the attacker an amount equal to
the damage dealt. Cannot do more damage than the attacker's max MP -
current MP. If the target is undead, then it heals the target, and hurts the
attacker instead.

Randomly casts Doom (see section 3.1).

**************
 3.20 Tempest
**************

When you attack, there is a 1 in 2 chance that Wind Slash will be cast. 
Casting Wind Slash replaces the weapon's attack rather than being cast in
addition to it, so it's not quite the same as magic randomly cast (see
section 3.1), and will not be disabled by the Offering (see section 5.11). 

******************
 3.21 Thief Knife
******************

Has a 50% chance of attempting to steal as well as dealing its normal damage.
When it attempts to steal, it is exactly as if the Capture command were used
(see section 6.1).

********************

When you don't have a weapon in either hand slot, the Empty item is treated
as your weapon.  It actually adds 10 to Battle Power, and has a respectable
hit rate of 200.



                                 ************

calculation.

Damage = Gold Thrown * 2 / # of enemies hit

Monsters use the gold you get when defeating them, rather than the party's gold.


***********
 6.4 Morph
***********

The morph command causes the character to morph into an esper.

While morphed, the character deals double normal damage, and receives half
normal damage from magical attacks. (see steps 5 and 6e in damage calculation).

The length of time you can stay morphed is based on the number of magic points
you have gained (the kind of magic points that are gained after battles). The
game keeps an invisible morph duration counter to determine how long morph
will last. At the beginning of the game, this counter is 0. Every time you win a
battle with Terra in your party, this counter is increased by 2x the amount of
MP you earned. If this counter is less than 16, then you can't morph. This
counter has a maximum value of 255.

Once you morph, there is another morph time counter to determine when morph will
wear off.  When you morph, this counter is set to 65535.  Every time the battle
time counter (see section 2.8 Battle Timing) is increased, the morph time
counter is reduced by an amount as follows:

((65535 / morph duration counter) / 16) + 1

When this counter reaches 0, morph wears off and you return to normal, with
the morph duration counter reset to 0.

If the battle ends, or you revert before the counter runs out, then the morph
duration counter is modified as follows:

new morph duration counter =
original morph duration counter * morph time counter / 65535.


************
 6.5 Throw:
************

Deals damage as a normal physical attack with these exceptions:

Adds 2 to the damage multiplier (in step 5 of damage calculation)

Is defense ignoring (skips steps 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, but not steps 5 or 7)

Ignores row (see section 3.3)

Is Unblockable (see step 3 in hit determination)

The Battle Power used is the Battle Power of the thrown weapon. The elemental
property of the weapon counts, but all other special properties of the thrown
weapon are ignored.


***********
 6.6 Steal
***********

1. If the monster has no items, then you automatically fail to steal.

2. If your level is >= 205 (hacks only), you automatically steal.
   (Skip steps 3 through 7)

3. StealValue = Your Level + 50 - Monster's level

4. If StealValue < 0 then you fail to steal.

5. If StealValue >=128 then you automatically steal.  (Skip steps 6 and 7)

6. If you have a Sneak Ring equipped:
      StealValue = StealValue * 2

7. If StealValue <= [0..99] then you fail to steal.

8. You have 1 in 8 chance of getting a rare item; otherwise, you get a common
   item.

9. If the monster doesn't have an item to steal in that slot, then you fail to
   steal; otherwise, you successfully steal that item.


************
 6.7 Sketch
************

The chance to successfully sketch an enemy is calculated as follows:

If (Sketcher's level * 256) / Target's level > [0..255] then
you successfully sketch, otherwise you miss.

If you are equipped with a Beret, then the chance to sketch is:

If (Sketcher's level * 256) / (Target's level * 170 / 256) > [0..255] then
you successfully sketch, otherwise you miss.

NOTE: Some monsters can never be sketched.

If you successfully sketch the enemy, then there 2 possible attacks that will
occur.  The first attack has a 25% chance of happening; the other attack has a
75% chance of happening.

Attacks resulting from Sketch use the sketcher's level to determine damage,
but the target's Vigor or Magic Power.


*************
 6.8 Control
*************

The chance to successfully control an enemy is calculated as follows:

If (Controller's level * 256) / Target's level > [0..255] then
you successfully control the enemy, otherwise you miss.

If you are equipped with a Coronet, then the chance to control is:

If (Controller's level * 256) / (Target's level * 170 / 256) > [0..255] then
you successfully control the enemy, otherwise you miss.

If the monster has any of the following statuses, then any attempt to control
them will fail: Clear, Zombie, Sleep, Muddle, Rage, Morph, Hide

NOTE: Some monsters can never be controlled.

Once an enemy is controlled, every time Relm's turn comes around you can
select one of 4 commands to use.  Each monster has their own list of commands.
Once the monster if hit with a physical attack, the control stops.

Note that attacks which cost more MP than the monster currently has will be
inaccessible and greyed out on Relm's Control menu.  Yet the spells don't
actually cost a controlled monster a red cent.  Go bloody figure.


**********
 6.9 Jump
**********

When a character lands from a Jump attack, the attack always hits (see step 3
in hit determination)

If you're equipped with a spear, then 2 is added to the damage multiplier (see
step 5 in damage calculation); otherwise, only 1 is added.

The attack also ignores row (i.e. skips step 4 of damage calculation).

If you are equipped with 2 weapons, then you will only get one attack, and one
will be randomly chosen to be attacked with.  If you are equipped with a spear
and a non-spear, then 2 is added to the damage multiplier, even if the non-spear
is the one that is attacked with.

************************
 7.1 Earth Wall (Golem)
************************

Will block physical damage for all party members.  The amount of damage it can
block is equal to the HP of the caster when it was cast.  Once it has blocked
that much damage, it will no longer block attacks for the rest of combat.


**************************
 7.2 Metamorph (Ragnarok)
**************************

Each enemy has a number 0 to 7 that determines how hard it is to morph.
For each value, The chance to morph is:

0: 99.609375%
1: 75%
2: 50%
3: 25%
4: 12.5%
5: 6.25%
6: 3.125%
7: 0%


Each monster has 4 items it can be morphed into. The item you get is randomly
determined from among the items, each having a 1 in 4 chance of being the
item you get.

                                 ***********

In order to learn Lores, Strago must be in the party when a lore is cast (Gogo
can't learn lores).  If Strago has any of the following statuses when the lore
is cast, then he won't learn the lore: Wound, Petrify, Zombie, Dark, Sleep,
Muddle, Stop, Hide, Rage, Freeze.  Strago's status at the end of battle doesn't
matter (he can even be dead).
